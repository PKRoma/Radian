<p><strong>Radian</strong> is an open source JavaScript library that makes it easy to embed plots in HTML documents. It is being developed as part of OpenBrain’s <a href="http://www.bayeshive.com">BayesHive</a> project.</p>
<p>Instead of writing JavaScript plotting code yourself, you use custom HTML elements to represent plots. For instance, the HTML code on the left produces the plot on the right:</p>
<div class="left50pct">
<pre class="sourceCode html"><code class="sourceCode html"><span class="kw">&lt;plot</span><span class="ot"> height=</span><span class="st">200</span><span class="ot"> aspect=</span><span class="st">2</span><span class="ot"> stroke-width=</span><span class="st">2</span>
<span class="ot">      x=</span><span class="st">&quot;[[seq(0,4*PI,101)]]&quot;</span>
<span class="ot">      axis-x-label=</span><span class="st">&quot;Time&quot;</span><span class="ot"> axis-y-label=</span><span class="st">&quot;sin(x) / cos(x)&quot;</span><span class="kw">&gt;</span>
  <span class="kw">&lt;lines</span><span class="ot"> y=</span><span class="st">&quot;[[sin(x)]]&quot;</span><span class="ot"> stroke=</span><span class="st">&quot;red&quot;</span><span class="kw">&gt;&lt;/lines&gt;</span>
  <span class="kw">&lt;lines</span><span class="ot"> y=</span><span class="st">&quot;[[cos(x)]]&quot;</span><span class="ot"> stroke=</span><span class="st">&quot;blue&quot;</span><span class="kw">&gt;&lt;/lines&gt;</span>
<span class="kw">&lt;/plot&gt;</span></code></pre>
</div>

<div class="right50pct">
<plot height="200" aspect="2" stroke-width="2" x="[[seq(0,4*PI,101)]]" axis-x-label="Time" axis-y-label="sin(x) / cos(x)"> <lines y="[[sin(x)]]" stroke="red"></lines> <lines y="[[cos(x)]]" stroke="blue"></lines> </plot>
</div>

<div class="clear50pct"></div>

<p>Radian uses the <a href="http://angularjs.org/">AngularJS</a> JavaScript framework to provide the machinery to implement custom HTML elements, and to allow two-way binding between attributes in HTML elements and JavaScript variables, and it uses the <a href="http://d3js.org/">D3.js</a> plotting library for graphics generation. Plots are generated as SVG elements embedded directly in the page, so can be rendered by most modern browsers.</p>
Radian is licensed under the <a href="license.html">Mozilla public license</a>.

<h3 id="rationale">Rationale</h3>
<p>There are many JavaScript plotting and graphing libraries out there, ranging in complexity from quick-and-easy utilities like <a href="http://www.flotcharts.org/">Flot</a> up to powerful but complex libraries like <a href="http://d3js.org/">D3.js</a>. These things are great, and produce attractive graphs, but they do require you to write JavaScript. Radian is a plotting API that works in a different way: plots are defined declaratively using custom HTML elements. Apart from a tiny bit of boilerplate setup code, you don’t need to write any JavaScript. This has a couple of benefits:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>For users who either don’t know JavaScript, don’t want to write it, or just want a quick and simple way to drop a plot into a web page, Radian offers an ideal solution – you write your plots inline in the HTML for your web page. (This works with other markup systems as well. All of these web pages are written in Markdown. All that’s needed to make Radian plots appear are a few <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tags to provide access to the Radian library and its dependencies.)</p></li>
<li><p>For more complex applications where there may be dozens of plots on a page, and where the numbers and contents of the plots aren’t known in advance, it’s much easier to generate HTML containing Radian’s custom tags than it is to generate an HTML page with parallel JavaScript code defining the plots. In fact, the development of Radian came out of just such an application: the <a href="http://www.bayeshive.com/">BayesHive</a> Bayesian statistical authoring system allows you to write literate documents describing complex statistical calculations, the results of which are rendered into Radian plots. It became apparent pretty quickly that we needed something like Radian to allow us to do this with a minimum of pain.</p></li>

<h3 id="we-couldnt-do-it-without">We couldn’t do it without…</h3>
<p>Radian leverages the power of two very cool JavaScript libraries:</p>
<p><a href="http://angularjs.org/">AngularJS</a> is a framework for building web applications that’s based on a couple of interesting and innovative ideas. The first is two-way data binding – you can easily set things up so that the contents of an HTML page are linked to JavaScript variables, so that changes in the JavaScript values are reflected immediately in the displayed page, and changes in the page (via interactive elements in forms) are propagated to the JavaScript values. The second idea is that of extending HTML with custom tags and attributes that to implement application-specific behaviours. As you’ll see, Radian makes heavy use of both of these ideas. For example, two-way data binding makes it almost trivial to produce interactive plots, and custom HTML elements are used everywhere: <code>&lt;plot&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;plot-data&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;lines&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;points&gt;</code>, and so on.</p>
<p>The second big thing we use is <a href="http://d3js.org/">D3.js</a>. This is a library for building “data-driven documents”. It’s quite complex to use, but it can produce amazing results – take a look at some of the <a href="https://github.com/mbostock/d3/wiki/Gallery">examples</a> for a taste of what it can do.</p>
<p>We wanted to take some of the best features of AngularJS and D3.js and use them to make a plotting API that was ridiculously easy to use for simple things, and possible to use for complex things.</p>
<p>As well as AngularJS and D3.js, we make use of a few other very useful libraries: we use a modified version of the <a href="http://marijnhaverbeke.nl/blog/acorn.html">Acorn JavaScript parser</a> and the <a href="https://github.com/Constellation/estraverse">estraverse</a> and <a href="https://github.com/Constellation/escodegen">escodegen</a> libraries for parsing and processing Radian expressions.</p>
